# [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Linear Regression](https://github.com/dandersonghub/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/main/EDA_Linear_Regression.ipynb)
This project demonstrates the process of using EDA to clean a dataset, understand the variables, and analyze the relationships between variables. EDA is an important step in the data analysis process where several techniques are utilized to better understand the dataset being used. A survey dataset of population health-related data was used. The objective of this project was to explore the dataset to determine the main features that have the most impact on blood pressure 'BP'.

Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to review and compared the relationships between the target and 7 potential predictor variables. The variable 'AGE' was determined to be the only statistically significant predictor of blood pressure with a moderate correlation of 0.46 and a p-value <0.001. Based on this analysis, the variable 'AGE' has been shown to significantly affect our target variable 'BP' and should be considered when performing predictive modeling.
